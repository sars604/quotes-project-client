## Wireframe and User Stories:

* As a user, I would like to get an inspirational quote.
* As a user, I would like to add a quote to my own list of quotes.
* As a user, I would like be able to update a quote in my list.
* As a user, I would like to delete a quote that I wrote.

## Planning and Development Stage:
The first step for this project was to come up with an idea that I was excited about where a user would be able to create, read, update, and delete a type of resource. I came up with the idea to create a place for a user to store quotes, and appropriately named it Quotable. When logged in as a user, they can create, update and delete their own quotes. They can also get inspiration from some of the quotes that I have seeded into my database.

The next step was creating a wireframe and writing user stories of basic functionalities that are important to my application. I tried to keep this very basic, as I wanted it to be very user-friendly and easy for a user to know what to do on my application. I also created a diagram for my backend so that I knew the relationship between my tables in my database.

Once I went to actually create my application, I started with building the API and testing it with Curl scripts. Once, I was happy with the functionality of my API, I started working on the front-end. I made sure that I was able to properly access my backend, and made sure that my CRUD functions worked on the frontend as well.

Once, I was happy with my backend and frontend, and how they related to each other - I worked on styling my frontend, so it would be easier for the user to use.

One thing that I had quite a hard time with, was the use of modals. I especially struggled when they were inside my handlebars file. I think if I were to do this project again, I would use less modals, and find another way to do that type of functionality.


## Unsolved Problems/Future Plans:

The main concern for future plans, would be to add a favorites list, so that my user can create their own quotes or pick from the general list of seeded quotes - and add them to a favorites list.
